ok, with this new brief i am thinking. I have $500 AUD ....... 

i am thinking about modifying the Injury Reports - Geoff had created those reports but the format is not consistent with the reports that you did and I need them to be like your format. 

I then need 2 angular new reports which tells me how much time and money the injury has cost... But the graph needs to look nice like stacked chat with line. I can't be sure until i see what is there but the site id down

So to do this, I need to also link the call log to injury reports... NOW this was already done by a previous dev 1 year ago but it never worked properly so it was later removed. Basically, if i entered an injury into the injury register, i could leave logs in the call log for that PARTICULAR injury... so my time on call would be attributed to that injury.

the drop down option in call log for workers comp needed to be adjusted so it had a sub menu... it might still be in the code, i am not sure. 

i need to add a new form filed called employee code in employee work details and a function which echos the persons name on a form when edit selected (in 3 areas)...

I also need to clean up this security issue today for another $100 and remove the public password and clean the site so the vulnerable files are gone

but that is the gist of what i am thinking of - when the site is back up i can revisit this
